## build-emoji.js

Regenerates `assets/js/emoji-data.js` from the Unicode CLDR data shipped in
the `emojibase-data` package.

```bash
npm i emojibase-data      # not vendored; only needed to regenerate
node tools/build-emoji.js
```

The generated file is committed, so a normal checkout needs no build step
and no npm install.

Two filters are applied deliberately:

- **Unicode <= 15.0.** Newer emoji render as tofu boxes on systems that
  haven't shipped the font update, which looks broken. Raise `MAX_VERSION`
  once the newer sets are widespread.
- **The "component" group is dropped.** Skin-tone modifiers and regional
  indicator letters are combining parts, not standalone emoji, and would
  appear as stray colour swatches and letter tiles in the grid.

Ordering within each group is CLDR order, which is what Android and Windows
use in their own pickers.

## test-*.js

jsdom harnesses, one per feature area. They need `jsdom` on the module path,
and `test-sql.js` additionally needs `pgsql-parser`:

```bash
npm i jsdom pgsql-parser
node tools/test-halo.js
```

Some are parameterised by a `SOCKET` env var, which decides whether the mocked
Supabase channel delivers realtime events (`live`), stays quiet so the polling
fallback has to cover (`silent`), or is left unset for the default path:

```bash
SOCKET=silent node tools/test-guard.js
```

`test-server`, `test-dms`, `test-rx`, `test-editdel`, `test-presence` and
`test-guard` are the socket-parameterised ones; the rest run single-mode. Each
prints one line per assertion and exits non-zero on the first failure.

`runall.sh` runs the lot.

Two are not jsdom tests:

- `test-sql.js` parses every `nexchat_patch*.sql` with the real Postgres
  grammar, since those files are pasted into the Supabase editor by hand and a
  syntax error otherwise surfaces mid-migration. It also enforces pure ASCII (a
  smart dash once broke a paste), guarded/idempotent DDL, and `search_path`
  pinning on `security definer` functions.
- `test-admin.js` covers admin promotion, mostly as a privilege-escalation
  regression net: that `is_platform_admin` is never written from the client,
  that the trigger guarding the column is present, and that the last admin
  cannot be demoted.

### Appearance regressions

`node tools/test-appearance.js` runs the real profile/server settings editors
against mocked persistence and storage. It covers immediate font paste/save,
colour and uploaded-font round trips, wallpaper key-only persistence, legacy
expired-URL recovery, failed saves, stale asynchronous results, and switching
between uploads, presets, external URLs and None. It also guards the wallpaper
stacking rules used by server chat. No live account or storage credentials are
needed. Run alongside `test-fonts.js`, `test-srvname.js`, `test-chatbg.js` and
`test-bgperf.js` (all require `jsdom`).
